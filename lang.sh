# Output-language resolver for claudish-to-english. Sourced by rewrite.sh and
# rewrite-md.sh — not executed directly.
#
# claudish_language [CWD] prints the language the rewrite should be written in,
# or nothing at all — and nothing means "no language was configured", which
# leaves the rewrite in whatever language the text it rewrites is already
# written in. English is not a default here, only one possible answer.
# First non-empty source wins:
#   1. CLAUDISH_LANG                      explicit override. Set but EMPTY
#                                         ignores the settings below and keeps
#                                         the text's own language; set it to
#                                         "English" to actually force English.
#   2. <cwd>/.claude/settings.local.json  .language

# 2-4 read the same `language` key Claude Code itself reads to build the
# "# Language" block of its system prompt, in the same precedence order. So a
# session already answering in one language gets its rewrite in that language,
# with nothing extra to configure.
#
# The value is normalized to at most three words and 30 codepoints, with control
# characters folded to spaces, because it lands in a system prompt and in an
# on-screen label — and a project's .claude/settings.json travels with the
# repository, so it is not necessarily the local user's own text. A language
# name fits ("Esperanto", "简体中文", "Brazilian Portuguese"); a paragraph of
# smuggled instructions does not, and neither does a terminal escape sequence.
# Every failure — no jq, unreadable or malformed JSON, missing or non-string
# key — comes back as an empty string, never an error: an unusable setting must
# leave rewrites working, in English.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Fold control characters to spaces, collapse whitespace, trim, keep at most 3
# words / 30 codepoints (jq slices by codepoint, so multibyte names survive).
# Empty in -> empty out.
#
# The control-character fold matters because this value is printed straight into
# the on-screen label, and ESC is not whitespace: without it a `language` of
# $'\033[2J' would reach the terminal as a real escape sequence. Folding to a
# space rather than deleting keeps "Brazilian\nPortuguese" two words, and turns
# an escape into harmless literal text that the word/length caps then trim.
# Filtering by codepoint (not a regex) avoids depending on how the regex engine
# spells a control-character class.
